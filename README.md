# Udacity - AI Programming with Python: Use a Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds
This project is part of the Udacity AI Programming with Python Nanodegree. The goal is to utilize an image classifier to accurately identify dog breeds.

## Description:
Your city is hosting a citywide dog show and you have volunteered to help the organizing committee with contestant registration. Every participant that registers must submit an image of their dog along with biographical information about their dog. The registration system tags the images based upon the biographical information.

Some people are planning on registering pets that arenâ€™t actual dogs.

You need to use an already developed Python classifier to make sure the participants are dogs.

## Objectives
- Image Classification: Determine the most effective image classification algorithm for distinguishing 'dogs' from 'not dogs'.
- Breed Identification: Determine the most effective image classification algorithm for identifying dog breeds.
- Efficiency Analysis: Measure the time each algorithm takes for classification, balancing between accuracy and runtime.

## Methodology
We will be using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on ImageNet, a massive dataset containing about 1.2 million images.

### Architectures to Explore
* AlexNet
* VGG
* ResNet

Each of these architectures has its unique structures and efficiencies, and part of our task is to determine which is most suitable for our specific needs.
